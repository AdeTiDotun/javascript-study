// Variable is a/the container that stores a value in it.
// There are also conventional ways of writing javascript language.
// It is also essential to make variables a lot descriptive.
let myFirstJob = "Sales rep";
let job1 = "sales rep"; //This second example is not descriptive enough.
// Overall, it's basically a box into which we can store a value.

let firstName = "Daniel";
console.log (firstName);
